## Project
A **project** is always identified by its [[wdbmeta.xml]]. A project always lives in an eXist-collection of its own. It may have sub-projects: these need to live in a sub-collection and MUST have a `wdbmeta.xml` of their own.
It is possible to have further sub-collections without `wdbmeta.xml` to bring order to the chaos of larger projects. These are not considered to be a project in their own right.
Each project is identified by the value of `projectMD/@xml:id` in its `wdbmeta.xml`. Hence, this value MUST be globally unique. This is not enforced, though, as importing projects, e.g. via git, may introduce duplicates that are more easily identified and handled from within the DB.

## Resource
While a resource can be anything that is stored in the DB, this term is narrowed down here. A resource is anything that is identified by an ID in a `wdbmeta.xml`. This includes that file itself and usually every XML file that is intended to be displayed. In this case, the value of `file/@xml:id` in `wdbmeta.xml` MUST be equal to the value of `@xml:id` on the top level element of the XML file, e.g. `doc('wdbmeta.xml')//file/@xml:id = doc('tei.xml')/TEI/@xml:id`.
Access to resources is by their ID, be that for any retrieval via [[REST|REST-endpoints]] or for display via `view.html`. Hence, a file’s ID MUST be globally unique. Again, this is not enforced but an error will be generated if more than one resource is found with any given ID.
