Welcome to the wdbplus wiki!

Some basic concepts etc. are to be documented here. Until there is a more definite documentation included within the app itself, this is the place for doc to go. It may also serve as a stable target for documentation of older releases.

If you want to know more about the structure of collections within the app and what you can change, please have a look at [[Basic Collection Structure|basic-collection-structure]].

An overview of how projects can be customized and the app's configuration options, see [[global-configuration]] and [[project-specifics]] as well as [[wdbmeta.xml]] for project metadata.

Functions you can use are listed in [[the list of JavaScript functions|js-functions]] and [[the list of XQuery functions|xq-functions]].

To learn about what the most important files in this app do, consult [[the list of main HTML files|main-html-files]] and [[the list of other main files|main-files]].
