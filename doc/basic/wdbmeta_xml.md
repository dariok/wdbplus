## Introduction to wdbmeta.xml

A fully detailed description of `wdbmeta.xml` is available in the XML Schema available in `{$approot}/include/wdbmeta`.
This documentation will cover the most important parts and how the file is evaluated in the app.

Evey project should have a `wdbmeta.xml` file. This is also true about the main data collection.
`wdbmeta.xml` is intended to replace `mets.xml` with a less verbose format while maintaining its functionality as a table of contents for a project.
While it is possible to solely rely on a `mets.xml`, the app is designed with `wdbmeta.xml` in mind.
Especially when it comes to rules for processing files, `wdbmeta.xml` is a lot easier to work with than a `mets.xml`.

The files main element in `projectMD` in the namespace `https://github.com/dariok/wdbplus/wdbmeta`.

## Main settings
|element|max. allowed|usage|

|titleData/title|+|The main title for this (sub-)project.|
